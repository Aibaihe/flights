    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) is a global aviation organisation with subsidiaries and equity 
        investments organised into four distinct business segments: Air Transportation Services, Ground Services, 
        Aircraft Leasing and Talent Development. This group structure was created to drive better transparency and 
        focused management across the respective operating subsidiaries, creating profit centre subsidiaries of the 
        company’s separate businesses. This ensures profit and loss accountability and unlocks the value of the 
        various assets by driving new levels of operational efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from ensuring better transparency and governance, the business segments will have flexibility to 
        explore collaborative opportunities for raising capital, making the subsidiaries more competitive and 
        responsive, thus strengthening our position in the market.
    </p>
    <p>
        The largest contributing segment of the Group is our Air Transportation Services which houses Ukraine 
        Airlines Berhad, network carriers serving the global and domestic markets and all passenger segments. Also under 
        the umbrella is the division UAB Cargo providing standard, express and special cargo. 
        The Group also includes ground handling services, engineering, training facilities as well as a dedicated aircraft 
        leasing company to provide customised and competitive aviation leasing solutions.
